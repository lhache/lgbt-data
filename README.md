## Methodology


## Question 1: do LGBT people feel less discriminated in Germany compared to France?

I am french but I'm living in Berlin since 8 years. My gut feeling says there's more acceptance towards LGBT people in Germany than in France but I would like to go through the data and look at what we can find out regarding this question.
I also have to take personal biases into account. I was born and grew up in a very small village in south of France, which is not quite representative of the whole french population. Similarly for Germany, I've only lived in Berlin which seems much more LGBT-friendly that many other places, including the rest of Germany.

So let's see what we can see from the data:



## Question 2: is there a diagonal in Europe?

I've got to travel quite a bit and have had the chance to meet people from many many different countries. I'd say that Scandinavia and western Europe tend to be acceptive towards LGBT, while eastern Europe would be on the other side of the spectrum.

Let's compare with the results from the analysis. The higher the score, the less reported discrimination.

So what can we infer from this?
- it seems there is more discrimination in eastern and southern Europe but it's not a norm.
- The UK case is quite puzzling, I'm wondering whether this is conclusive or not.



## Question 3: do transgenders feel more discriminated than other categories?

My gut feeling is that there is more discrimination towards transgenders than towards homosexuals or bisexuals.
